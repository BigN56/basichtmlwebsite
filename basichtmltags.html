    <h1>Intro to tags</h2>

    <p>
      When you type your tags, you should type 2 tags. 1 is an opening tag, and
      one is a closed tag. the opening tag should be surrounded by these 2
      characters: &lt; &gt;. Your closed character should be surrounded by these
      characters: &lt; /&gt; There are some acceptions, like br. Br doesn't need a
      closed tag. You will soon learn what br is.
