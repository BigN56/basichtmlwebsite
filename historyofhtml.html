<h2>Timeline of HTML</h2> 
    <p><strong>Birth of HTML (1989-1991): </strong>HTML was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, in the late 1980s while working at CERN. In 1989, he developed the first proposal for what would become the World Wide Web. Initially, HTML was a simple markup language used to create static web pages with links.
    </br><strong>HTML 1.0 (1991): </strong>The first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was published in 1991. It included basic elements for structuring a web page such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
</br><strong>HTML 2.0 (1995): </strong>HTML 2.0 introduced more features including tables, text formatting, and forms. This version laid the foundation for the web to become more interactive.
</br><strong>HTML 3.2 (1997): </strong>HTML 3.2 brought further enhancements such as support for scripts and applets, which allowed for more dynamic content on web pages. It also introduced support for style sheets.
</br><strong>HTML 4.01 (1999): </strong>HTML 4.01 was a major update that introduced features like cascading style sheets (CSS), which separated the structure and presentation of web pages. It also introduced support for multimedia elements like images and video.
</br><strong>XHTML (2000):</strong> XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) was introduced as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML syntax. XHTML aimed to make HTML more extensible and interoperable with other XML-based technologies.
</br><strong>HTML5 (2014): </strong>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and represents a significant evolution of the language. It introduced many new features including native support for video and audio, canvas for drawing graphics, geolocation, local storage, and semantic elements such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, etc. HTML5 also provides better support for mobile devices and accessibility.</p>
